# Controllers

Lilya embraces both functional and object-oriented programming (OOP) methodologies.
Within the Lilya framework, the OOP paradigm is referred to as a *controller*, a nomenclature inspired by other notable technologies.

The `Controller` serves as the orchestrator for handling standard HTTP requests and managing WebSocket sessions.

Internally, the `Controller` and `WebSocketController` implement the same response wrappers as the
[Path](./routing.md#path) and [WebSocketPath](./routing.md#websocketpath) making sure that remains
as one source of truth and that also means that the [auto discovery](./routing.md#auto-discovering-the-parameters) of
the parameters also works here.

## The `Controller` class

This object also serves as ASGI application, which means that embraces the internal implementation
of the `__call__` and dispatches the requests.

This is also responsible for implementing the HTTP dispatching of the requests, only.

```python
{!> ../../../docs_src/controllers/controller.py!}
```

When employing a Lilya application instance for routing management, you have the option to dispatch to a `Controller` class.

!!! warning
    It's crucial to dispatch directly to the class, not to an instance of the class.

Here's an example for clarification:

```python
{!> ../../../docs_src/controllers/dispatch.py !}
```

In this scenario, the `ASGIApp` class is dispatched, not an instance of it.

`Controller` classes, when encountering request methods that do not map to a corresponding handler,
will automatically respond with `405 Method Not Allowed` responses.

## The `WebSocketController` class

The `WebSocketController` class serves as an ASGI application, encapsulating the functionality of a `WebSocket` instance.

The ASGI connection scope is accessible on the endpoint instance through `.scope` and features an attribute called `encoding`.
This attribute, which may be optionally set, is utilized to validate the expected WebSocket data in the `on_receive` method.

The available encoding types are:

- `'json'`
- `'bytes'`
- `'text'`

There are three methods that can be overridden to handle specific ASGI WebSocket message types:

1. `async def on_connect(websocket, **kwargs)`
2. `async def on_receive(websocket, data)`
3. `async def on_disconnect(websocket, close_code)`

```python
{!> ../../../docs_src/controllers/websocketcontroller.py !}
```

The `WebSocketController` is also compatible with the Lilya application class.

```python
{!> ../../../docs_src/controllers/wdispatch.py !}
```

# Context

The `Context` is a beauty of an object unique to **Lilya**. The `context` is a parameter that
can be used **inside the function handlers** and provides additional information
that you might need for any particular reason.

Very similar approach to [Request](./requests.md) in terms of implementation but not the same.
In fact, a `context` contains also the request and information about the handler itself.

Importing is as simple as:

```python
from lilya.context import Context
```

## The `Context` class

You can see the `context` as the `request context` of a given handler. This also means, when
a function handler (view) is declared all the information passed to it
is automatically accessible via `context.handler` parameter.

```python
{!> ../../../docs_src/context/app.py !}
```

The `context` also provides access to the [`request`](./requests.md) object as well as the
[application settings](./settings.md) and other functions.

This means, if you want to pass a `request` and `context` you actually only need the `context`
directly as the request is already available inside but you can still pass both anyway.

**Example**

```python
from lilya.apps import Lilya
from lilya.context import Context
from lilya.routing import Path


def read_context(context: Context, id: str):
    host = context.request.client.host

    context_data = context.get_context_data()
    context.add_to_context("name", "Lilya")

    context_data = context.get_context_data()
    context_data.update({
        "host": host, "user_id": id
    })
    return context_data


app = Lilya(
    routes=[
        Path("/users/{id}", read_request)
    ]
)
```

The `context` becomes especially valuable when you need to retrieve `handler` information that is
unavailable after the handler's instantiation. For instance, it proves useful when accessing
`context.settings` to retrieve application settings, offering a versatile approach to accessing them.

## Attributes

### Handler

The function handler that is responsible for the request.

```python
from lilya.context import Context
from lilya.responses import Response


def home(context: Context):
    handler = context.handler

    return Response("Ok")
```

### Request

The request being used for the scope of the handler.

```python
from lilya.context import Context
from lilya.responses import Response


def home(context: Context):
    request = context.request

    return Response("Ok")
```

### User

The user allocated in the request.

```python
from lilya.context import Context
from lilya.responses import Response


def home(context: Context):
    user = context.user

    return Response("Ok")
```

### User

The user allocated to the request.

```python
from lilya.context import Context
from lilya.responses import Response


def home(context: Context):
    user = context.user

    return Response("Ok")
```

### Settings

The [settings](./settings.md) being used by the Lilya application.

This can be the global settings or if a `settings_module` was provided, returns that
same settings.

```python
from lilya.context import Context
from lilya.responses import Response


def home(context: Context):
    settings = context.settings

    return Response("Ok")
```

### Scope

The scope of the application handler.

```python
from lilya.context import Context
from lilya.responses import Response


def home(context: Context):
    scope = context.scope

    return Response("Ok")
```

### Application

The Lilya application.

```python
from lilya.context import Context
from lilya.responses import Response


def home(context: Context):
    app = context.app

    return Response("Ok")
```

## Methods

The `context` provides also different functions to manipulate the object.

### get_context_data

The context of the application. This can be particularly useful when
working with templates.

```python
from lilya.context import Context
from lilya.responses import Response


def home(context: Context):
    context = context.get_context_data()

    return Response("Ok")
```

### add_to_context

Adding values into the current context.

```python
from lilya.context import Context
from lilya.responses import Response


def home(context: Context):
    context.add_to_context("call", "ok")

    return Response("Ok")
```

### path_for

Retrives the path of a specific handler.

```python
from lilya.context import Context
from lilya.responses import Response


def home(context: Context):
    url = context.path_for("/home")

    return Response(url)
```

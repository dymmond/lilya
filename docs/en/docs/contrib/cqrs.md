# CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)

## Overview

**CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)** is an architectural pattern that separates:

- **Commands** → operations that **change state**
- **Queries** → operations that **read state**

In CQRS, these two concerns are handled by **different execution paths**, often with different models,
validation rules, performance characteristics, and even storage mechanisms.

Lilya provides a **lightweight, explicit, framework-native CQRS implementation** via `lilya.contrib.cqrs`, designed to:

- integrate naturally with Lilya endpoints
- remain async-first
- avoid hidden magic or global state
- work with Lilya encoders and existing request/response patterns

This is **CQRS without ceremony**.

---

## Why CQRS exists

Traditional request handlers often mix responsibilities:

```
HTTP Request
 └── validate input
 └── fetch data
 └── mutate data
 └── apply business rules
 └── return response
```

As applications grow, this leads to:

- bloated endpoints
- unclear business boundaries
- difficult testing
- tight coupling between reads and writes
- poor scalability characteristics

!!! tip "CQRS addresses this by enforcing a simple rule"
    A command never returns data. A query never changes state.

---

## When CQRS makes sense

CQRS is **not mandatory** for every Lilya application.

You should consider CQRS when:

- business logic becomes non-trivial
- writes and reads have different lifecycles
- multiple endpoints trigger the same write logic
- the same read logic is reused in many places
- you want explicit domain boundaries
- you want testable business logic outside HTTP

You probably **do not need CQRS** when:

- the app is CRUD-only
- logic is trivial
- performance and scale are not concerns
- endpoints are thin and unlikely to grow

CQRS is a **tool**, not a rule.

## CQRS in Lilya

Lilya's CQRS implementation lives in:

```shell
lilya.contrib.cqrs
```

It provides:

- `CommandBus`
- `QueryBus`
- message envelopes
- handler registries
- optional middleware pipelines
- decorator-based registration (optional)

It **does not** introduce:

- background queues
- persistence layers
- event sourcing
- transport protocols

Those can be layered on later if needed.

---

## Core concepts

### Commands

A **Command** represents an **intent to change state**.

**Examples**:

- Create a user
- Update a password
- Delete an order
- Send an email

**Commands**:

- are explicit objects
- are validated before execution
- **do not return data**
- may fail

```python
class CreateUser:
    def __init__(self, user_id: str, email: str) -> None:
        self.user_id = user_id
        self.email = email
```

---

### Queries

A **Query** represents a **request for information**.

**Examples**:

- Get user profile
- List orders
- Check permissions

**Queries**:

- never mutate state
- return a value
- can be cached
- should be idempotent

```python
class GetUserEmail:
    def __init__(self, user_id: str) -> None:
        self.user_id = user_id
```

---

### Handlers

Handlers contain **business logic**, not HTTP logic.

#### Command handler

```python
def handle_create_user(cmd: CreateUser) -> None:
    database.insert_user(cmd.user_id, cmd.email)
```

#### Query handler

```python
def handle_get_user_email(q: GetUserEmail) -> str | None:
    return database.get_email(q.user_id)
```

Handlers:

- are plain Python callables
- may be sync or async
- are easy to test
- can be reused across endpoints

---

## CommandBus and QueryBus

### CommandBus

Used to **dispatch commands**.

```python
from lilya.contrib.cqrs import CommandBus

command_bus = CommandBus()
command_bus.register(CreateUser, handle_create_user)

await command_bus.dispatch(CreateUser("u1", "u1@example.com"))
```

- one handler per command type
- no return value
- exceptions bubble up

---

### QueryBus

Used to **execute queries**.

```python
from lilya.contrib.cqrs import QueryBus

query_bus = QueryBus[str | None]()
query_bus.register(GetUserEmail, handle_get_user_email)

email = await query_bus.ask(GetUserEmail("u1"))
```

- returns a value
- supports sync and async handlers
- can be cached or optimized independently

---

## Using CQRS inside Lilya endpoints

This is the **recommended usage pattern**.

### Example: Create and retrieve a user

```python
from lilya.apps import Lilya
from lilya.routing import RoutePath
from lilya.responses import JSONResponse
from lilya.requests import Request

from lilya.contrib.cqrs import CommandBus, QueryBus
```

#### Setup buses and handlers

```python
store: dict[str, str] = {}

command_bus = CommandBus()
query_bus: QueryBus[str | None] = QueryBus()

def handle_create(cmd: CreateUser) -> None:
    store[cmd.user_id] = cmd.email

def handle_get(q: GetUserEmail) -> str | None:
    return store.get(q.user_id)

command_bus.register(CreateUser, handle_create)
query_bus.register(GetUserEmail, handle_get)
```

---

#### Write endpoint (Command)

```python
async def create_user(request: Request):
    data = await request.json()

    await command_bus.dispatch(
        CreateUser(user_id=data["user_id"], email=data["email"])
    )
    return JSONResponse({"status": "created"}, status_code=201)
```

---

#### Read endpoint (Query)

```python
from lilya.requests import Request
from lilya.responses import JSONResponse


async def get_user(request: Request):
    user_id = request.path_params["user_id"]
    email = await query_bus.ask(GetUserEmail(user_id))

    if email is None:
        return JSONResponse({"detail": "not found"}, status_code=404)

    return JSONResponse({"user_id": user_id, "email": email})
```

---

#### Lilya application

```python
from lilya.apps import Lilya
from lilya.routing import Path

app = Lilya(
    routes=[
        Path("/users", create_user, methods=["POST"]),
        Path("/users/{user_id}", get_user),
    ]
)
```

---

## Why this is better than logic in endpoints

Without CQRS:

- logic is locked inside HTTP
- cannot be reused elsewhere
- hard to test without HTTP clients

With CQRS:

- handlers are pure business logic
- endpoints become thin orchestration layers
- logic can be reused by:
  - background jobs
  - admin panels
  - CLI commands
  - GraphQL resolvers
  - internal services

---

## Middleware in CQRS

CQRS buses support **middleware pipelines**, similar to HTTP middleware but scoped to domain logic.

### Example: auditing or validation

```python
from lilya.logging import logger
from lilya.contrib.cqrs import CommandBus

async def logging_middleware(message, next):
    logger.info("Handling %s", type(message).__name__)
    return await next(message)

command_bus = CommandBus(middleware=[logging_middleware])
```

Middleware can:

- log
- mutate messages
- short-circuit execution
- add tracing
- enforce permissions

---

## Default buses and decorators (optional)

For small applications or quick prototypes, Lilya provides **module-level default buses**.

```python
from lilya.contrib.cqrs import command, query
```

```python
from lilya.contrib.cqrs import command

@command(CreateUser)
def handle_create(cmd: CreateUser) -> None:
    ...
```

```python
from lilya.contrib.cqrs import query

@query(GetUserEmail)
def handle_get(q: GetUserEmail) -> str | None:
    ...
```

This is convenient, but **explicit buses are recommended** for larger systems to avoid global coupling.

---

## Testing CQRS logic

CQRS handlers are **trivial to test**.

```python
def test_create_user():
    store = {}

    def handler(cmd: CreateUser):
        store[cmd.user_id] = cmd.email

    bus = CommandBus()
    bus.register(CreateUser, handler)

    bus.dispatch(CreateUser("u1", "x@y.com"))

    assert store["u1"] == "x@y.com"
```

No HTTP. No ASGI. No TestClient required.

---

## Summary

CQRS in Lilya:

- is explicit, not magical
- keeps business logic out of endpoints
- scales with application complexity
- integrates naturally with Lilya
- remains fully async-native
- is optional and composable

Use it when **your domain deserves structure**.

Avoid it when **simplicity is enough**.

---

## Next steps

- Combine CQRS with:
    - background tasks
    - caching
    - observables
- Introduce message envelopes for transport
- Add persistence or event sourcing if needed

CQRS is a foundation — not a constraint.

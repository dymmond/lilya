# Test Client

Lilya comes with a test client for your application tests. It is not mandatory use it as every application and
development team has its own way of testing it but just in case, it is provided.

## Requirements

This section requires the Lilya testing suite to be installed. You can do it so by running:

```shell
$ pip install Lilya[test]
```

## The test client

```python
{!> ../../../docs_src/testclient/example1.py !}
```

You can use any of the `httpx` standard API like authentication, session cookies and file uploads.

```python
{!> ../../../docs_src/testclient/example2.py !}
```

**TestClient**

```python
{!> ../../../docs_src/testclient/example3.py !}
```

`httpx` is a great library created by the same author of `Starlette` and `Django Rest Framework`.

!!! Info
    By default the TestClient raise any exceptions that occur in the application.
    Occasionally you might want to test the content of 500 error responses, rather than allowing client to raise the
    server exception. In this case you should use `client = TestClient(app, raise_server_exceptions=False)`.

## Lifespan events

!!! Note
    Lilya supports all the lifespan events available and therefore `on_startup`, `on_shutdown` and `lifespan` are
    also supported by `TestClient` **but** if you need to test these you will need to run `TestClient`
    as a context manager or otherwise the events will not be triggered when the `TestClient` is instantiated.

Lilya also brings a ready to use functionality to be used as context manager for your tests, the `create_client`.

### Context manager `create_client`

This function is prepared to be used as a context manager for your tests and ready to use at any given time.

```python
{!> ../../../docs_src/testclient/example4.py !}
```

The tests work with both `sync` and `async` functions.

!!! info
    The example above is used to also show the tests can be as complex as you desire and it will work with the
    context manager.

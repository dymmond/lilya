# Release Notes

## 0.7.3

### Fixed

- Documentation generation for `typing.Unpack`.

## 0.7.2

### Changed

- Optimised the `encoders` and how it evaluates the `ENCODER_TYPES`.
- Internal fixes in the `TestClient` and internals.

## 0.7.1

### Fixed

- Import cast clashing with local variables.

## 0.7.0

### Added

- New [EnvironLoader](./environments.md) support.

### Fixed

- Internal `AsyncExitStack` middleware raising exception.

## 0.6.1

### Changed

- Internal support for `hatch` and removed the need for a `Makefile`
- Documentation references
- Internals for Directives. [#54](https://github.com/dymmond/lilya/pull/54) by [@devkral](https://github.com/devkral).

## 0.6.0

### Fixed

- `add_arguments` from BaseDirective to not raise `NotImplementedError` exception.

## 0.5.0

### Added

- `settings_module` also supports import as string

#### Example

```python
from lilya.apps import Lilya
from lilya.requests import Request
from lilya.routing import Path


async def home(): ...


app = Lilya(
    routes=[Path("/", handler=home)],
    settings_module="myapp.configs.settings.AppSettings",
)
```

## 0.4.0

### Added

- `encoders` directly embed in any response. The `encoders` is a list of `lilya.encoder.Encoder` type
of objects that can be passed directly into the response. SInce the responses can be independent ASGI applications,
the encoders can be passed directly there.

## 0.3.5

### Changed

- Documentation improvements.

### Fixed

- Typo in the create project directive urls file descripton.

## 0.3.4

### Added

- Extra validations to handle the events.

## 0.3.3

### Added

- `settings_module` when passed in the instance of Lilya will take precedence
over the global settings, removing the need of using constantly the `LILYA_SETTINGS_MODULE`.
- `ApplicationSettingsMiddleware` as internal that handles with the `settings_module` provided and maps
the context of the settings.

#### Example of the way the settings are evaluated

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

from lilya.apps import Lilya
from lilya.conf import settings
from lilya.conf.global_settings import Settings
from lilya.responses import Ok
from lilya.routing import Include, Path

async def home():
    title = getattr(settings, "title", "Lilya")
    return Ok({"title": title, "debug": settings.debug})


@dataclass
class NewSettings(Settings):
    title: str = "Settings being parsed by the middleware and make it app global"
    debug: bool = False


@dataclass
class NestedAppSettings(Settings):
    title: str = "Nested app title"
    debug: bool = True


app = Lilya(
    settings_module=NewSettings,
    routes=[
        Path("/home", handler=home),
        Include(
            "/child",
            app=Lilya(
                settings_module=NestedAppSettings,
                routes=[
                    Path("/home", handler=home),
                ],
            ),
        ),
    ],
)
```

In the context of the `controller home`, based on the path being called, it should return the
corresponding value of the `title` according to the settings of the app that is included.

### Changed

## 0.3.2

instances.

### Changed

- Add `__slots__` to  `Request`.

## 0.2.3

### Added

### Fixed

## 0.2.1

### Changed

## 0.1.2

# Release Notes

## 0.3.4

### Added

- Extra validations to handle the events.

## 0.3.3

### Added

- `settings_module` when passed in the instance of Lilya will take precedence
over the global settings, removing the need of using constantly the `LILYA_SETTINGS_MODULE`.
- `ApplicationSettingsMiddleware` as internal that handles with the `settings_module` provided and maps
the context of the settings.

#### Example of the way the settings are evaluated

```python
from dataclasses import dataclass

from lilya.apps import Lilya
from lilya.conf import settings
from lilya.conf.global_settings import Settings
from lilya.responses import Ok
from lilya.routing import Include, Path

async def home():
    title = getattr(settings, "title", "Lilya")
    return Ok({"title": title, "debug": settings.debug})


@dataclass
class NewSettings(Settings):
    title: str = "Settings being parsed by the middleware and make it app global"
    debug: bool = False


@dataclass
class NestedAppSettings(Settings):
    title: str = "Nested app title"
    debug: bool = True


app = Lilya(
    settings_module=NewSettings,
    routes=[
        Path("/home", handler=home),
        Include(
            "/child",
            app=Lilya(
                settings_module=NestedAppSettings,
                routes=[
                    Path("/home", handler=home),
                ],
            ),
        ),
    ],
)
```

In the context of the `controller home`, based on the path being called, it should return the
corresponding value of the `title` according to the settings of the app that is included.

### Changed

## 0.3.2

### Fixed

- Missing requirements needed for the `pip install lilya[cli]`

## 0.3.1

instances.

### Changed

- Add `__slots__` to  `Request`.

## 0.2.3

### Added

- Alias `Middleware` to be imported from `lilya.middleware`.

### Fixed

## 0.2.2

## 0.2.1

### Changed

## 0.2.0

### Added

- Internal form parser was duplicating the values.

## 0.1.2

### Fixed

## 0.1.1

### Fixed

## 0.1.0

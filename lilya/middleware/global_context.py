    GlobalContextMiddleware is an ASGI middleware that initializes a global context for each request.

    This middleware inherits from ABC and MiddlewareProtocol, ensuring it adheres to the ASGI middleware interface.

    Attributes:
        app (ASGIApp): The ASGI application instance.

    Methods:
        __init__(app: ASGIApp):
            Initializes the middleware with the given ASGI application.

        __call__(scope: Scope, receive: Receive, send: Send) -> None:
            Asynchronously handles the incoming request, sets up a new global context,
            and then calls the next middleware or application in the stack.

    Usage:
        This middleware should be added to the ASGI application stack to ensure that
        a fresh global context is available for each request. This can be useful for
        storing request-specific data that needs to be accessed globally within the
        request lifecycle.

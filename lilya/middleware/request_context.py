    Middleware to manage request context in an ASGI application.

    This middleware ensures that the request context is properly set and reset
    for each incoming HTTP request. It uses a global request context to store
    the current request, which can be accessed throughout the application.

    Attributes:
        app (ASGIApp): The ASGI application instance.

    Methods:
        __init__(app: ASGIApp):
            Initializes the middleware with the given ASGI application.

        __call__(scope: Scope, receive: Receive, send: Send) -> None:
            Handles incoming requests, sets the request context, and ensures
            it is reset after the request is processed.
